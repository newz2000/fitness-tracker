# This is a demo Django app

The goal is to learn the basics of Django. Clone this app to have a working example.

## Username / Password

There are two users created, matt and lestertester. I don't know the passwords for these users. 
To create a new admin user, from the terminal type:

    python manage.py createsuperuser
    
and follow the instructions to create a new user.
